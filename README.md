Run the demo in latest Chrome/Firefox to train the model using your own words and corresponding signs/gestures. If you have an Echo plugged in closeby, it should respond, otherwise simply play around and have fun. You will need to give permission to access your webcam and microphone.


## Running the code
To use the code, first install the JavaScript dependencies by running  

```
npm install
```

Then start the local budo web server by running 

```
npm start
```

This will start a web server on [`localhost:9966`](http://localhost:9966). 

1. Allow permission to your webcam and microphone.

2. Add some words you want to train on.
